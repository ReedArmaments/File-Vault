**Thank you for downloading the Hoffman Tactical Super AR-9 Lower!**

This folder contains the V1.0 AR-9 lower. Two versions are avalible. The Super version requires the brass inserts from the Hoffman Tactical Reinforcement Kit. While the Basic version does not.

Keep in mind that this is the first version of the AR-9 to be released, and as such it has not been fully tested. Have care when using these files!

The only non AR-15 part needed is a 3/32" DIA x 1" Long roll pin for the mag catch. The mag catch spring is the same spring used with the AR-15 mag catch. Assembly of the ejector into the lower should be intuitive. 

See this page for basic AR-15 assembly instructions: https://hoffmantactical.com/how-to-installing-bushings/

Happy Printing!

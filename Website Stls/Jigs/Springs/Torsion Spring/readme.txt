I looked every where and could not find a specific JIG that makes Torsion springs so I had to design my own, this works both clockwise and counter clockwise and works flawlessly with a 100% success rate. I have given you three sizes to choose from 6,8 & 10mm and I'll be adding more on a later date, you will only require one handle for all 3 jigs. 

Items Requires:
JIG:
1 X CONNECTOR NUT (2mm BIGGER THAN YOUR JIG SIZE)
1 X M6, M8, M10 (DEPENDING ON THE JIG)
2 X M5 WELD NUTS
2 X M5 HEX BOLT
2 X PLATES (USE THE TEMPLATE TO CUT OUT OF 2mm STEEL)
1 X WASHER 2MM THICK

HANDLE:
1 X M10 HEX BOLT X  L (FOR THE GRIP)
2 X M10 NUTS
1 X M5 WELD NUTS
1 X M5 HEX BOLT

!!!Note: I'm always open for suggestion and help on improving the design and proof of concept.

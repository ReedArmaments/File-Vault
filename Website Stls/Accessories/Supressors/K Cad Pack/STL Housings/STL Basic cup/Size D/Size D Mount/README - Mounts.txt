These are suppressor mounts. A suppressor mount is the part of the suppressor that connects to the muzzle of your firearm via your 
firearm's threads. The threads on these suppressor mounts are very strong when 3D printed in standard PLA, and are sufficient enough to 
handle the pressures of calibers listed in the !!README!!/manual. Match the threads of your firearm to one of the threads/files listed for 
the proper suppressor mount. If your firearm does not have any matching threads of those listed, you will have to build or purchese a 
thread adapter. If you do not know what threads your firearm has, refer to the internet.

This is a new and improved iteration of my remix to FFFTech's Balance Mini Grip. It has been extended by ~20mm, reversed the inlaid pattern, and added ribs (for her pleasure) on the front side of the grip.

Pretty straight forward print - print as orientated in the image, 100% cooling fan after the 3rd-5th layer, support X/Y distance should be >=1.0 mm to keep it away from the pattern.

Tag @xYeezySZN and @FFFTech in your makes!
